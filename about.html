    <div class="kicker">About Supervision</div>
    <h1>Most people's first experience of VP goes badly. We started Supervision to fix that.</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      VP is powerful. But too often it gets sold as a technology, not a production tool. The result: overpromised, misunderstood, and expensive for the wrong reasons.
    </p>
    <p class="lede">
      We started Supervision because someone needed to be in the room who understood both sides — the tech and the production. And who'd be honest about when they don't fit together.
    </p>
  </section>

  <div class="grid">
    <section class="card" style="grid-column:span 6">
      <h3>What we kept seeing</h3>
      <p>Virtual production enters most projects as a tech demo. Pixel pitch. Unreal versions. Tracking systems. And that's where you lose people — because in production, new means risk.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 12px;">What teams actually buy into is reliability. Predictability. Solutions that make tomorrow's schedule easier — that's what gets a green light.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" style="grid-column:span 6">
      <h3>How We Think About It</h3>
      <p>We don't start with what VP can do. We start with what you need — your goals, your constraints, your reality. Then we work backwards to the right tools.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 12px;">Sometimes that's an LED stage. Sometimes it's a plate shot in a car park. Sometimes it's not VP at all. Knowing when not to use it is part of the job.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" style="grid-column:1/-1">
      <h3>Why independent matters</h3>
      <p>Supervision isn't a vendor and isn't a facility. We're independent — which means we recommend what fits, not what we happen to sell.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 12px;">We sit between the technology and the production, making sure everyone speaks the same language.</p>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <blockquote class="pullquote">When the tech disappears, it's just filmmaking again.</blockquote>
