# Supervision Website Redesign – Design Document

**Date:** 2026-01-06
**Status:** Approved

---

## Overview

Redesign of Supervision VP website to achieve:
- **Visual impact** – Cinematic, premium, technically precise, bold confidence
- **Professional credibility** – Trust signals, client logos, case studies
- **Clear user flow** – Two distinct paths for two audiences

---

## Target Audiences

### 1. Productions (Primary Path)
- Producers, line producers, creatives
- Narrative, factual, commercials
- Need: "Help us with this show/commercial"

### 2. In-House/Corporate (Primary Path)
- Corporate teams, brands, studios
- Building VP capability internally
- Need: "Help us build VP capacity for ongoing content"

---

## Homepage Structure

### Hero (Split Composition – 55/45)

**Left side:**
- Kicker: "VIRTUAL PRODUCTION • PRODUCTION-LED"
- Headline: "VIRTUAL PRODUCTION THAT STARTS WITH YOUR PROBLEM, NOT THE TECHNOLOGY"
- Subhead: "We help productions and organisations use VP when it genuinely makes sense – and tell you when it doesn't."
- Client logo strip: BBC, ITV, Dyson, BAFTA, World Productions, Apple

**Right side:**
- Striking project still (or placeholder)
- Subtle parallax on scroll
- Retro stripes as accent element

**Animations:**
- Headline/subhead fade up (staggered)
- Logos fade in after text
- Image: slow Ken Burns zoom
- Stripes: slow gradient shift

### The Fork

**Intro:** "How can we help?"

**Card 1 – Productions (Teal accent)**
- Title: "TV, Film & Commercials"
- Subtitle: "We help productions solve real problems with VP – narrative, factual, branded content"
- Hover reveals: "Schedule & budget-led approach", "Plates, LED, CG – whatever fits", "On-set and post supervision"
- CTA: "Explore VP for productions →"

**Card 2 – In-House (Orange accent)**
- Title: "In-House & Corporate"
- Subtitle: "Build VP capability for ongoing content creation – without the massive upfront spend"
- Hover reveals: "Feasibility & planning", "Training & upskilling", "Scalable system design"
- CTA: "Explore VP in-house →"

**Animations:**
- Cards fade/slide up on scroll
- Hover: lift + shadow + reveal content
- Stripe accents pulse on hover

### Social Proof Bar
- Full-width darker band
- "Trusted by productions at" + logo strip (larger)
- Or: "BAFTA-nominated work. Major broadcasters. Global brands."

### What Makes Us Different (3 columns)
1. "Production-first" – Start with schedule, budget, risk
2. "Tool-agnostic" – Plates, LED, CG, AI – whatever fits
3. "Honest advice" – We'll tell you if VP isn't right

Colored dot accents (teal, orange, gold). Fade in staggered.

### Featured Work (Teaser)
- 1-2 project cards with images
- "Vigil – BBC" / "Dyson – Commercial"
- Hover: image zoom, "View project →"

### Final CTA
- "Not sure where to start?"
- "Start a conversation →" button (primary/orange)

## Productions Path Page

### Hero
- Kicker: "VP FOR PRODUCTIONS"
- Headline: "VIRTUAL PRODUCTION THAT WORKS FOR YOUR SCHEDULE, BUDGET, AND CREATIVE"
- Subhead: "Drama, factual, returning series, features, commercials – we've supervised VP across all of them."
- Background: Project still with dark overlay

### How We Work (Timeline/Steps)
1. "Start with constraints" – Schedule, budget, risk, locations
2. "Choose the right approach" – Plates, LED, CG, or blend
3. "Keep production in the loop" – No black-box workflows
4. "Protect creative freedom" – VP removes constraints

Sequential reveal on scroll.

### Proof (Case Studies)
- Grid of 2-3 cards: Vigil, Dyson, etc.
- Image, title, one-line description, "View case study →"
- Hover: lift + image zoom

### Client Logos
- "We've worked with productions at:"
- Full logo strip, larger format

### FAQ / Objection Handling
- Accordion style
- "Is VP right for my project?"
- "What does VP actually cost?"
- "How early should we involve you?"

### Final CTA
- "Let's talk about your production"
- Contact button
- "No pitch deck. Just a conversation."

## In-House Path Page

### Hero
- Kicker: "VP FOR IN-HOUSE TEAMS"
- Headline: "BUILD VP CAPABILITY FOR ONGOING CONTENT CREATION"
- Subhead: "We help corporates and brands develop in-house virtual production – scoped realistically, built sustainably."
- Background: BTS photo or abstract treatment

### What It Doesn't Have to Mean (Myth-busting)
1. "A massive LED wall" – Start small, scale when it makes sense
2. "Replacing your team" – We upskill who you have
3. "One vendor lock-in" – We design for flexibility

Visual: Strikethrough or "X" treatment, then reframe.

### Use Cases
1. **Content creation studios** (primary) – Ongoing video content at scale
2. **Digital environments** – Virtual showrooms, retail spaces
3. **Training & simulation** – Scenario-based learning

### How We Help (Services)
1. Feasibility & planning
2. Training & upskilling
3. Scalable system design
4. Ongoing support & guidance

### What to Expect
- Discovery → Recommendation → Implementation → Support
- Sets expectations, reduces uncertainty

### Final CTA
- "Explore whether VP fits your organisation"
- "We'll give you a straight answer."
